# Guide 06 — Area View

The Area View is the resource-level detail screen for a single configuration area. Navigate here by clicking **Manage** on an area card, or by clicking the area name in the sidebar.

## Header

```
← TenantName / Area Name

Area Name                    [Baseline Active]  [Read only]
Area description
Last synced: 20/03/2026, 4:53 am

                            [Restore All (2)]  [Pull Live Data]  [Edit Baseline]
```

- **Last synced** — the exact timestamp of the last successful pull for this area (per-area, not tenant-wide)
- **Restore All (N)** — appears when there is drift and write permissions are granted
- **Pull Live Data** — immediately pulls fresh configuration from Graph for this area only
- **Edit Baseline** — opens the Baseline Editor

---

## Tabs

| Tab | Content |
|---|---|
| **Configuration** | Live diff view — baseline vs current state |
| **Restore Log** | Full history of all restore actions for this area |
| **Baseline History** | All archived baseline versions |

## Configuration tab

### Filter bar

When an area has more than 4 resources, a filter bar appears above the resource list:

- **Search** — filter by resource name or ID
- **Status toggle** — All / Drifted / Clean
- A result count appears when a filter is active (e.g. "3 of 47")
- **Clear** removes all active filters

### Resource display

**When baselined:**

Resources are shown in two sections — monitored resources and (collapsed) resources not in the baseline.

Drifted and missing resources appear at the top. Each drifted resource is expanded by default:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔴 Anto Porter                    [Properties]  [Restore] │
│                                                      │
│  Baseline (desired state)  ⟷  Live (current state)  │
│                                                      │
│  displayName                                         │
│  "Anto Porter"            →    "Anto Por"      [Fix] │
│                                                      │
│  department                                          │
│  "Engineering"            →    "AAAA"          [Fix] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Clean resources appear below drifted ones, collapsed by default.

**Before baseline:**

All live resources are listed. A yellow prompt explains how to set a baseline to begin monitoring.

### Column headers

- **Baseline (desired state)** — the value saved when you created the baseline
- **Live (current state)** — the value pulled from Microsoft 365 right now

### Fix and Restore buttons

| Button | Location | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Fix** | Next to a drifted property | Restore that single property to its baseline value |
| **Restore** | Resource card header | Restore all drifted properties on this resource |
| **Restore All (N)** | Area header | Restore all drifted resources in this area |

All restore actions are logged immediately in the Restore Log tab and trigger an automatic re-pull of the area.

---

## Restore Log tab

Shows every restore action for this area in reverse chronological order.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Status | ✅ Restored or ❌ Failed |
| Type | Property / Full / Bulk / Auto-restore |
| Resource | Human-readable name of the affected resource |
| Properties | Each field that was patched |
| Timestamp | When the restore executed |
| Error | Graph error message when a restore fails |

Up to 50 entries are shown. The log is append-only.

---

## Baseline History tab

Lists all archived baseline versions for this area in reverse chronological order.

Each version shows:

- **Label** — the name you gave when saving
- **Saved at** — timestamp of when this version was created
- **Resources** — count of resources included in that version
- **Monitoring modes** — a breakdown of Properties vs Snapshot resources

**To restore an archived version:**

Click **Restore** on any entry. The current baseline is archived first, then the selected version becomes active. All future syncs will compare against the restored version.

**To preview an archived version:**

Expand the version to see the resources and their saved property values. This is useful for understanding what has changed between versions.

---

## Read-only areas

Some areas are read-only either by design or by permission:

| Reason | What you see |
|---|---|
| No write permission | Yellow "Read only" badge in the header. All restore buttons are hidden. |
| Monitor-only collector (e.g. App Protection Policies) | "Monitor only" indicator. Restore is not possible. |
| Custom collector | "Custom · Read-Only" badge. Restore is not available for custom areas. |

---

## Locked areas

If a required read permission is missing, the area shows a **Locked** overlay with the specific permission name that needs to be added. Navigate to Entra ID → API permissions, add the permission, grant admin consent, and re-sync.
